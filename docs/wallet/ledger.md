# How To Use Your Ledger Device With The Alephium Browser Extension

### **INTRODUCTION**

A Ledger Device is a hardware wallet considered one of the most secure ways to store your digital assets. Ledger uses an offline, or cold storage, method of generating private keys, making it a preferred method for many crypto users.

### BEFORE YOU START, MAKE SURE:

1. You’ve initialized your Ledger Device.
2. The latest firmware has been installed.
3. Ledger Live is [ready to use](https://support.ledger.com/article/4404389606417-zd).
4. You have the latest [Alephium Browser Extension Wallet](https://alephium.org/#wallets) installed.

### INSTALL THE ALEPHIUM APP

1. Open **My Ledger** in Ledger Live.
2. Connect and unlock your Ledger Device.
3. If asked, follow the onscreen instructions and **Allow Ledger Manager**.
4. Find **Alephium** in the app catalog.
5. Click the Install button.

**Important:** As transfers of ALPH or other tokens are handled by UTXOs on Alephium blockchain, the flow to send any type of token is the same.


### ENABLING BLIND SIGNING ON YOUR LEDGER

Blind signing means signing a transaction without knowing or seeing the full transaction data before authorizing it. – The user should be mindful of this and proceed with caution, ensuring that the source is trusted. You can find more information about blind signing in this [article](https://www.ledger.com/academy/cryptos-greatest-weakness-blind-signing-explained)

For Ledger Flex/Stax:

**Click on the “gear” at the top right.** In the new page, turn the toggle on. Click on the arrow to go back to the main page.
